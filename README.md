## Architecture

**MVVM**

## Issues
* There is a lack of information from Google on how Paging 3 can be tested thoroughly,
probably still being worked on, as the library is still in alpha, hence this sample sticks to basic paging test cases.

## Cases handled

![](docs/Landscape.png)

* Network connectivity change is detected, app displays disconnected toast.
* Page state and loaded images are still retained, even in offline mode.
* Kill and restart app, loads cache data first and attempts network connection in the background.
* Fresh search is made automatically once network is established again.
* All data retrieved is retained in DB and app can be used completely in offline mode as well, showing cached data.
